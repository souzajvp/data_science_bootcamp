# data_science_bootcamp
Repository to hold my progress on the Bootcamp Data Science Applied in Health promoted by ALURA.

## Something about me:

My name is João Vítor Perez de Souza, I am a Biomedic and currently a PhD student at the State University of Maringá-Paraná, Brazil. My thesis is mainly focused on the development of new drugs to treat Tuberculosis, a respiratory disease that was the leader in annual deaths by an infectious agent in the world before COVID-19.<br>
<font color='Blue'> >> </font>I have always had a taste for bioinformatics, and more recently I started to learn about programming, data science and python. Bootcamp has been an incredible experience to learn from people who have experience in the area. Additionally, the knowledge and cofindence that I obtained throughout the Bootcamp has already enabled me to start partnerships with researchers who are in the field. <br>
